            <h1>National Resource for <br>
                Mechanistic Modeling of Cellular Systems</h1>
            <p>This Resource formally brings together two foundational software packages, COPASI and 
                Virtual Cell (VCell). The Resource will maintain and enhance these two widely used 
                shared modeling tools. As the VCell and COPASI platforms were developed over the last 
                two decades, researchers have come to recognize and appreciate the ability to explore 
                quantitative experimental data within the context of specific mechanistic hypotheses 
                and to use the predictive power of simulation for experimental design. Today 
                computational analysis is a driving force in complex experiments while computational 
                models are leading to the development of experimental methods.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Over the years, the VCell and COPASI development teams have been committed to educating 
                our user communities on the value of mathematical modeling and how to utilize modeling 
                techniques in their research. In parallel, the team has been actively committed to 
                supporting the expanding field of computational cell biology. Accordingly, we have 
                created this Computational Cell Biology website as a source of information about cell 
                biology modeling for the entire research community. Here you can find out about 
                standards, other software tools and the many available workshops for in depth training 
                throughout the year. Visit the links to learn more about <a href="https://copasi.org/" target="_blank">COPASI</a>
