            took place at R. D. Berlin 
            Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling (CCAM) on May 23-25th. For 3 days, 
            more than 40 online participants learned how to use VCell, COPASI and 
            SpringSalad software tools for modeling of cell biology systems. 16 
            participants participated in the “project track”, working individually 
            with CCAM staff on developing their modeling projects.

    <h3>Slepchenko Publication</h3>

      (02-18-22) Congratulations to Boris Slepchenko on his latest publication with CCAM alumnus Masoud 
      Nickaeen, <a href="https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E21-07-0362" target="_blank">A model of actin-driven endocytosis explains differences of endocytic motility in 
      budding and fission yeast.</a> In this article they showed that a molecularly explicit model of 
      forces exerted by actin filaments on endocytic invaginations explains the differences in 
      endocytic invaginations between budding and fission yeast.
